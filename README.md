# NYC Taxi Analytics Pipeline with BigQuery, dbt & Tableau

## Project Overview

This project documents my hands-on learning journey in building an end-to-end data analytics pipeline using Google BigQuery, dbt Core, SQL, and Tableau.

Using the NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Records (Q1 2022), I practiced transforming raw transactional data into business-ready datasets before developing an interactive dashboard using Tableau for reporting and analysis.

Throughout this project, I explored a modern analytics workflow, including data warehousing in BigQuery, SQL transformation, dbt modeling, data validation, and dashboard development in Tableau.

Due to the limitations of a personal Google Cloud account, this project focuses on NYC Yellow Taxi trips during Q1 2022. Although the dataset scope is intentionally limited, the overall workflow reflects practices commonly used in real-world data analytics projects.

## Learning Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to gain practical experience in building a modern data analytics workflow using industry-standard tools.

Throughout this project, I practiced:

- Building a cloud-based data warehouse using Google BigQuery
- Writing SQL transformations to create business-ready datasets
- Learning and implementing dbt for modular data transformation
- Organizing data into staging and mart layers
- Applying basic data validation using dbt tests
- Exporting aggregated datasets for reporting
- Designing an interactive dashboard in Tableau
- Managing project documentation and version control with GitHub

## Project Architecture

This project follows a modern ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) workflow. Raw trip data is loaded into Google BigQuery, transformed into business-ready datasets using SQL and dbt, exported as aggregated reporting tables, and finally visualized in Tableau.

## Data Model

The project follows a layered data modeling approach to transform raw transactional data into business-ready datasets for reporting and dashboard development.

### Source Layer

The raw NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Records are stored in Google BigQuery without business transformations. This layer serves as the single source of truth for the project.

### Staging Layer

The staging layer standardizes the raw data by:

- Renaming columns with consistent naming conventions
- Converting data types
- Removing unnecessary fields
- Creating derived date and time attributes
- Preparing clean datasets for downstream transformations

### Mart Layer

The mart layer contains aggregated datasets optimized for business reporting and Tableau dashboards.

The following reporting tables were created:

| Model | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `mart_daily_trips` | Daily revenue and trip performance |
| `mart_hourly_trips` | Trip distribution by hour of day |
| `mart_weekday_trips` | Revenue and trips by weekday |
| `mart_kpi_summary` | Executive KPI summary for dashboard |

This layered approach improves data organization, simplifies maintenance, and supports reusable analytics workflows.

## dbt Lineage

The data transformation workflow was implemented using dbt Core, allowing each transformation step to be organized into reusable and modular data models.

The lineage graph illustrates the dependency between the source data, staging model, and mart models, making the transformation pipeline easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

### Interactive dbt Documentation

The modular design enables each transformation model to be developed, tested, and maintained independently while preserving clear dependencies across the entire analytics workflow.
