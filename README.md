# NYC Taxi Analytics Pipeline with BigQuery, dbt & Tableau

## Project Overview

This project documents my hands-on learning journey in building an end-to-end analytics pipeline using Google BigQuery, dbt Core, and Tableau.

Using the NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Records (Q1 2022), I built an end-to-end analytics pipeline that transforms raw trip data into analytics-ready data marts for interactive Tableau reporting.

Throughout this project, I implemented a modern analytics workflow, including data warehousing in BigQuery, SQL-based transformations with dbt, data validation, and dashboard development in Tableau.

Due to the limitations of a personal Google Cloud account and resource quotas, the complete NYC Yellow Taxi dataset was not practical to process within this project. Therefore, the analysis focuses on Q1 2022, while the end-to-end ELT workflow, data modeling, and dashboard development reflect the same practices used in real-world analytics projects.

## Project Highlights

- End-to-end ELT workflow using Google BigQuery and dbt
- Modular dbt data models (Source → Staging → Mart)
- SQL-based transformations to build analytics-ready data marts
- Interactive Tableau dashboard with executive KPIs
- Maintainable analytics project structure with Git and GitHub

## Learning Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to gain practical experience in building a modern analytics engineering workflow using industry-standard tools.

Throughout this project, I practiced:

- Building a cloud-based data warehouse using Google BigQuery
- Developing modular SQL transformations with dbt
- Building staging and mart models using dbt
- Applying data quality validation with dbt tests
- Generating dbt documentation and model lineage
- Designing an interactive Tableau dashboard
- Managing project version control and documentation with Git and GitHub

## Project Architecture

This project follows a modern ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) architecture. Raw NYC Yellow Taxi trip data is stored in Google BigQuery, transformed into modular staging and mart models using dbt, exported as analytics-ready datasets, and visualized through an interactive Tableau dashboard.

## Data Model

The project follows a layered dbt modeling approach to transform raw trip data into analytics-ready data marts for reporting and dashboard development.

### Source Layer

The raw NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Records are stored in Google BigQuery without business transformations. This layer serves as the single source of truth for the project.

### Staging Layer

The staging layer standardizes the raw data by:

- Renaming columns with consistent naming conventions
- Converting data types
- Creating derived date and time attributes
- Preparing clean datasets for downstream transformations

### Mart Layer

The mart layer contains analytics-ready data marts optimized for reporting and Tableau dashboards.

| Model | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `mart_daily_trips` | Daily revenue and trip performance |
| `mart_hourly_trips` | Trip distribution by hour |
| `mart_weekday_trips` | Revenue and trips by weekday |
| `mart_kpi_summary` | Executive KPI summary |
| `mart_taxi_dashboard` | Consolidated reporting model for dashboard development |

This layered modeling approach improves maintainability, reusability, and scalability for analytics workflows.

## dbt Lineage

The transformation workflow was built with dbt Core using modular SQL models, dependency management, automated testing, and project documentation.

The lineage graph below illustrates how the source table is transformed into staging and mart models before being consumed by the analytics dashboard.

### Lineage Graph

## Business Insights

The dashboard provides interactive insights into NYC Yellow Taxi operations, helping answer key business questions through executive KPIs and visual analytics.

The dashboard helps answer questions such as:

- How does total revenue change throughout Q1 2022?
- Which month generates the highest revenue?
- What are the busiest operating hours?
- Which weekdays contribute the most trips and revenue?
- How does daily revenue fluctuate over time?
- What is the average value of each completed trip?
- What is the average number of passengers per trip?

These insights help transform raw trip records into actionable business information through an intuitive reporting interface.
